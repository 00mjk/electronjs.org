      Userland is where people in software communities come together
      to share tools and ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      The term "userland" originated in the Unix community, where it referred to
      any program that ran outside of the "kernel". The kernel is the core of
      an operating system, and a bridge between applications and the actual
      data processing done at the hardware level.

      More recently, userland has become an important term in the JavaScript
      community, where Node.js is the core, and the npm package registry 
      is "userland".
    </p>

    <p>
      Like Node, Electron is focused on having a small set of APIs that provide
      all the core features needed for developing multi-platform Desktop applications.
      This design philosophy allows Electron to remain a flexible tool without being
      overly prescriptive about how it should be used. Userland enables users to
      create and share tools that provide additional functionality on top of what is
      available in Electron "core".

      This list is constructed by analyzing the <code>dependencies</code>
      of every public GitHub repository that also depends on Electron.
