The Electron community is growing quickly, and people are creating powerful
new apps and tools at an astounding rate. To celebrate this creative momentum
and keep the community informed of some of these new projects, we've decided to
start a weekly blog series featuring noteworthy Electron-related projects.

This post is the first in the series, and features [Kap](https://getkap.co/),
an open-source screen recording app built by [Wulkano](https://wulkano.com/),
a geodistributed team of freelance designers and developers.
